title: Create the Client API Keys

[The Agave API](http://developer.tacc.cloud/), (a component of the SD2E API), is
used to configure your user environment to interact with the SD2E platform. If
you do not yet have the CLI installed and in your `$PATH`, first go
[here](01.install_cli.md) to install it.

<br>
#### Initiate with the SD2E Agave tenant

On the command line, perform:
```
% tenants-init -t sd2e

You are now configured to interact with the APIs at https://api.sd2e.org/
```

This new configuration is stored in an Agave configuration file located in your
home directory: `~/.agave/current`

<br>
#### Create API keys

API keys are used to authenticate and store your user credentials for a specific
client application. To generate API Keys:
```
% clients-create -S -N sd2e_client -D "My client used for interacting with SD2E"
API username:   # enter TACC username
API password:   # enter TACC password

Successfully created client sd2e_client
key: a7vddofNefw4j95Uwcd_fdJHdtsIa
secret: Wsdhy_ckT3aneUWfVyZfdagFagLja
```

Keep your keys secure and do not share with others.

<br>
#### Listing and deleting API keys

To find client keys you have previously generated, you can use the `clients-list`
command:
```
% clients-list
API username:   # enter TACC username
API password:   # enter TACC password

DefaultApplication
sd2e_client
```

In this case, two clients exist for this user and on the current tenant: the
default `DefaultApplication` and newly generated `sd2e_client`. If needed, you
can delete then regenerate client API keys with the following:
```
% clients-delete [CLIENT_NAME]
```

<br>
#### The `~/.agave/current` configuration file

In addition to the tenant ID, your API keys are stored in the Agave configuration
file. To view the contents of the file:
```
% cat ~/.agave/current
```

CLI commands can be used to manage different configuration files for swapping
between tenant and user space. Use the `-h` flag with any CLI command to learn
more, e.g.: `tenants-init -h`.
