Agave [systems](02.create_systems.md) are described by `json` files and added
to the SD2E tenant using the command line interface. To modify a system after it
has been added, simply edit the original `json` file and use the command line
interface to push the changes to the SD2E tenant.

#### Modify an Agave system

This is an example Agave storage system `json` file from an
[earlier section](02.create_systems.md) of this user guide:
```
{
  "id": "jetstream-storage-username",
  "name": "My Jetstream Storage System",
  "description": "My system for storing data on jetstream instance 129.114.104.39",
  "status": "UP",
  "type": "STORAGE",
  "storage": {
    "host": "129.114.104.39",
    "port": 22,
    "protocol": "SFTP",
    "rootDir": "/home/username",
    "homeDir": "/",
    "auth": {
      "publicKey": " <enter public key here> ",
      "privateKey": " <enter private key here> ",
      "username": "username",
      "type": "SSHKEYS"
    }
  }
}
```

This storage system is attached to a [Jetstream instance](https://jetstream-cloud.org/).
Users of this and other cloud environments know that IP addresses for instances may
change. If your Jetstream instance IP address changes, there is no need to delete the old
storage system and create a new one. Instead, you can modify the existing storage system
to use the new IP address.

Edit the original system `json` file to reflect the new IP address (in the case above,
the `description` and `host` fields would need to be edited. Then, perform the
following:
```
% systems-addupdate -F jetstream-storage-username.json jetstream-storage-username
```

To confirm that the changes have taken place, verbosely list the contents of the
storage system:
```
% systems-list -v jetstream-storage-username
```

#### Further help

Additional system `json` fields can be found in in the online
[Agave documentation](http://developer.tacc.cloud/).
