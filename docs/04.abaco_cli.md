The *Abaco CLI* is a command line interface for working with actor based
containers. Also called **actors** or **reactors**, these are arbitrary, containerized
executables or instructions that can be triggered in response to an event.

The introduction to the Abaco CLI below is adapted from the tutorial
[found here](https://github.com/TACC-Cloud/abaco-cli).

<br>
#### Installation and set up

If you have already installed the [SD2E CLI](01.install_cli.md) and set up
[authorization tokens](01.authorization.md), then no further set up is required.
Test that `abaco` is in your path by typing:
```
% abaco

Usage: abaco [COMMAND] [OPTION]...

Set of commands for interacting with Abaco API. Options vary by
command; use -h flag after command to view usage details.

Commands:
  list, ls, actors, images      list actors
  create, make, register        create new actor
  delete, remove, rm            remove actor
  update, change                update base Docker image
  permissions, share            list and update actor permissions
  workers, worker               view and add workers
  submit, run                   run actor
  executions                    view actor executions
  logs                          view execution logs
  init                          create a new actor project
  deploy                        build and deploy an actor
```


<br>
#### Command summary

As seen above, issuing '`abaco`' on an empty line will show the command summary.
Help text for each command can be viewed with the `-h` flag. For example:
```
% abaco list -h

Usage: abaco list [OPTION]...
       abaco list [OPTION]... [ACTORID]

Returns list of actor names, IDs, and statuses or JSON description of
actor if ID provided

Options:
  -h    show help message
  -z    api access token
  -v    verbose output
  -V    very verbose output
```


<br>
#### Create and run an actor

At the core of a actor is a Docker container. Here, we will spin up an
instance of a Docker image called `jturcino/abaco-trial` available on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jturcino/abaco-trial/). The entrypoint
for this container simply prints some information in the current environment to
standard out, which will be captured in the actor logs.

First, create a actor named `example-actor` and pass in environment variables
with the `-e` flag:
```
% abaco create -n example-actor -e foo=bar -e bar=baz jturcino/abaco-trial:latest
example-actor  5v165gLJwWmR6
```

The command '`abaco list`' can be used to check the actor's status. Provide the
actor ID to get a more detailed description:
```
% abaco list
example-actor  5v165gLJwWmR6  READY
```
```
% abaco list 5v165gLJwWmR6
{
  "message": "Actor retrieved successfully.",
  "result": {
    "_links": {
      "executions": "https://api.sd2e.org/actors/v2/5v165gLJwWmR6/executions",
      "owner": "https://api.sd2e.org/profiles/v2/username",
      "self": "https://api.sd2e.org/actors/v2/5v165gLJwWmR6"
    },
    "createTime": "2018-04-27 17:28:38.482897",
    "defaultEnvironment": {
      "bar": "baz",
      "foo": "bar"
    },
    "description": "",
    "gid": 827385,
    "id": "5v165gLJwWmR6",
    "image": "jturcino/abaco-trial:latest",
    "lastUpdateTime": "2018-04-27 17:28:38.482897",
    "mounts": [
      {
        "container_path": "/work",
        "host_path": "/work",
        "mode": "rw"
      },
      {
        "container_path": "/corral",
        "host_path": "/corral-repl/projects/SD2E-Community",
        "mode": "rw"
      }
    ],
    "name": "example-actor",
    "owner": "username",
    "privileged": false,
    "state": {},
    "stateless": false,
    "status": "READY",
    "statusMessage": " ",
    "tasdir": "01234/username",
    "type": "none",
    "uid": 827385,
    "useContainerUid": false
  },
  "status": "success",
  "version": "0.6.0"
}
```

Once the status is `READY`, run the actor with '`abaco submit`'. It is required to
pass a message to the actor with the `-m` flag, which will be added to the
environment:
```
% export MESSAGE='{"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"}'
% abaco submit -m "$MESSAGE" 5v165gLJwWmR6
gAbVREpGeE1VY
{
  "key1": "value1",
  "key2": "value2"
}
```

When an actor is run, an `execution ID` is returned along with the contents of
the input message.

#### Check execution status, workers, and logs

Abaco 'executions' are conceptually similar to Agave 'jobs'. You can check the
list of executions run against a specific actor by performing:
```
% abaco executions 5v165gLJwWmR6
gAbVREpGeE1VY
```

The status of a specific execution can be found by providing its ID as well:
```
% abaco executions 5v165gLJwWmR6 gAbVREpGeE1VY
kQVAMo38XDKZw  COMPLETE
```

The other ID returned (`kQVAMo38XDKZw`) is known as the `worker ID` for the
actor. By default, each actor is only assigned one worker, meaning it can only
handle one process at a time (additional processes are queued). The full list of
workers associated with an actor and their current status can be found using the
`abaco workers` command:
```
% abaco workers 5v165gLJwWmR6
kQVAMo38XDKZw  READY
```

Finally, you can bring up the logs of a specific execution by providing the actor
ID and execution ID:
```
% abaco logs 5v165gLJwWmR6 gAbVREpGeE1VY
Logs for execution gAbVREpGeE1VY:

  "_abaco_jwt_header_name": "X-Jwt-Assertion-Sd2E"
}

ROOT FILES:
bin boot dev etc home lib lib64 media mnt opt proc root run sbin srv sys tmp usr
var agavepy script.py requirements.txt .dockerenv work corral _abaco_results.sock
corral-repl
```

In the job logs you will find the environment variables that were defined when
the actor was created, and variables that were passed via message when the
specific instance of the actor was executed.


<br>
#### Modify, share, and delete an actor

When the base image behind an actor is re-tagged, the actor can be updated to
use the newer version. For example:
```
% abaco update -i jturcino/abaco-trial:update 5v165gLJwWmR6
example-actor  5v165gLJwWmR6

% abaco list 5v165gLJwWmR6
...
    "image": "jturcino/abaco-trial:update",
...
```

Similar to [Agave apps](03.share_app.md), abaco actors can be shared with
other users on the SD2E tenant. For example, to share your actor with a user
named `my_collaborator`, perform:
```
% abaco permissions -u my_collaborator -p EXECUTE 5v165gLJwWmR6
my_collaborator  EXECUTE
username         UPDATE
```
Valid permission levels are `NONE`, `READ`, `EXECUTE`, and `UPDATE`.

Finally, actors can be deleted with the '`abaco delete`' command:
```
% abaco delete 5v165gLJwWmR6
Actor deleted successfully.
```
