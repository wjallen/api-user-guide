In certain circumstances, it is advantageous to use public / private SSH keys
to authenticate with the Agave API. Specifically, this is important when
[creating your own private systems](02.create_systems.md). Having SSH keys
will make it easier to interact with systems that do not allow password
authentication or that require frequent password changes, and it will increase
security by preventing the need to store your password in a plain text file.

If you are new to the Agave CLI and the SD2E Agave tenant, it is recommended to
skip this section of the documents until you need to
[create your own private systems](02.create_systems.md).

#### Prerequisites

For this example, we will demonstrate how to generate keys for an Atmosphere VM
instance on [Jetstream](https://jetstream-cloud.org), although these instructions
are generic and can be applied to most systems. We need:

* Hostname / IP address for target system
* User account and login credentials for target system

<br>
#### Log in to the remote system

First, remotely log in to the system on which you plan to make a private HPC or
STORAGE system:
```
% ssh username@129.114.104.39
username@129.114.104.39's password:
Welcome to
    _   _                             _
   / \ | |_ _ __ ___   ___  ___ _ __ | |__   ___ _ __ ___
  / _ \| __| '_ ` _ \ / _ \/ __| '_ \| '_ \ / _ \ '__/ _ \
 / ___ \ |_| | | | | | (_) \__ \ |_) | | | |  __/ | |  __/
/_/   \_\__|_| |_| |_|\___/|___/ .__/|_| |_|\___|_|  \___|
                               |_|
[js-104-39] %
```

<br>
#### Generate SSH keys

Next, generate a secure set of RSA SSH keys using the Linux utility `ssh-keygen`.
Here, we call the public / private key pair 'agave_rsa', and we only use it for
this system, and only for Agave:
```
[js-104-39] % ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -b 4096 -C user@email.com -f agave_rsa -N ''

[js-104-39] % cat agave_rsa
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

...etc

[js-104-39] % cat agave_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAgEA1kto/IyPDmXR4Rk/I0ubRqV/IF5h
...etc
```

<br>
#### Authorize public key

Finally, add your public key to the `authorized_keys` file on your remote system:
```
[js-104-39] % cat agave_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Your private key (`agave_rsa`) will be used in the future when it is time to
[create your own private systems](02.create_systems.md). Never share your
private key with anyone else.
