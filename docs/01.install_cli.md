title: Install and Configure the SD2E CLI
tagline:
---

The primary method for interacting with the SD2E platform is the
[SD2E command line interface (CLI)](https://github.com/SD2E/sd2e-cli).
The SD2E CLI is a collection of several other CLIs including Agave, Abaco,
TACCLab, and TACCReg. In total, they comprise  ~150 shell scripts and other
resources for managing authorization, files, systems, applications, jobs, and
more.

There are three methods to install the CLI, choose whichever fits your preferred
working environment:
1. Run an installer script to install in ~/sd2e-cloud-cli/bin/
2. Manual install to a location of your choosing
3. Pull a CLI Docker image

<br>
#### Requirements

Make sure in your environment, you have:
1. [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
2. [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/)
3. [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
4. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
5. [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
6. [python 2.7+ or 3.x+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

<br>
#### Install method 1: Run an installer script to install in `~/sd2e-cloud-cli/bin/`

Open a terminal window and run the installer script:
```
% curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sd2e/sd2e-cli/master/install/install.sh | sh
```

This will install the executables and write an `export PATH` command to your
`~/.bashrc`. To make the changes take effect immediately:
```
% source ~/.bashrc
```

Finally, verify that the CLI has been installed by issuing the following:
```
% sd2e info

DARPA SD2E version: 1.0.6
TACC Cloud API tenant: sd2e.org
TACC Cloud API versions:
        Science APIs: 2.2.5
        Reactors API: dev
        TACC Accounting API: v1
```

<br>
#### Install method 2: Manual install to a location of your choosing

Open a terminal window and navigate to your preferred location for installation:

```
% mkdir sd2e-project && cd sd2e-project
```

Download and unpack the CLI:
```
% curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sd2e/sd2e-cli/master/sd2e-cloud-cli.tgz \
       -o sd2e-cloud-cli.tgz
% tar -xvzf sd2e-cloud-cli.tgz
```

Then add the CLI executables to your `PATH`:
```
% echo "PATH=\$PATH:$PWD/sd2e-cloud-cli/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
% source ~/.bashrc
```

Finally, verify that the CLI has been installed by issuing the following:
```
% sd2e info

DARPA SD2E version: 1.0.6
TACC Cloud API tenant: sd2e.org
TACC Cloud API versions:
        Science APIs: 2.2.5
        Reactors API: dev
        TACC Accounting API: v1
```

<br>
#### Install method 3: Pull a CLI Docker image *(outdated)*

The CLI is also available as a Docker image. For this to work, it is assumed you
have a reasonably recent version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
Pull the latest image and verify CLI availability by performing:
```
% docker pull sd2e/cloud-cli:latest
% docker run -it -v $HOME/.agave:/root/.agave sd2e/cloud-cli bash
```

Then from within Docker, verify that the CLI is available:
```
/home$ sd2e info

DARPA SD2E version 1.0.1
TACC Cloud API tenant: sd2e
TACC Cloud API versions:
        Science APIs: 2.2.5
        Reactors API: dev
        TACC Accounting API: v1
```

<br>
#### Influential environment variables

When working with the SD2E platform, you may optionally set some of the following
environment variables. In bash, it will take the form:
```
% export VAR_NAME=option
e.g.
% export AGAVE_JSON_PARSER=jq
```

<table style="width:100%" border="1px" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <th align="left">Environment variable</th>
    <th align="left">Options</th>
    <th align="left">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AGAVE_JSON_PARSER</td>
    <td>jq, json_mirror, json, python, native</td>
    <td>Set this to your favorite json parser (if installed)</td>
  <tr>
  </tr>
    <td>AGAVE_DISABLE_AUTO_REFRESH</td>
    <td>1, 0</td>
    <td>Set this to `1` to disable auto refresh of the OAuth2 token</td>
  </tr>
</table>
