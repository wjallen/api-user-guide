Here, we will take the first steps in developing our own Agave app. It is assumed
that you already have an executable in mind (i.e. a program that you would like
to run), and you have an idea of how you would like to run it (i.e. what are the
inputs and outputs, what flags might be used, etc.).

#### Develop an app by example

*Prerequisite: `git` should be installed on your local machine*

On the [SD2E GitHub pages](https://github.com/SD2E/reactors-etl),
you will find examples of several apps that have already
been built. Clone the entire repo using git and navigate into the `reactors` folder:
```
% git clone https://github.com/SD2E/reactors-etl
Cloning into 'reactors-etl'...

% cd reactors-etl/reactors/
% ls
fcs-tasbe/              hello-container/        lcms/                   sailfish/
fcs-tasbe-tacc/         kallisto/               msf/
```

As of this writing, there are seven example apps including `hello-container`,
which is both a simple example app and a template for creating new apps. Spend
some time navigating through the folders to get an idea of what components are
part of an app bundle.

<br>
#### Structure of an app

The basic structure of an app looks as follows:
```
hello-container/
├── Dockerfile
├── build.sh
├── deploy.sh
├── hello-container-0.1.0
│   ├── _util
│   │   └── container_exec.sh
│   ├── app.json
│   ├── app.yml
│   ├── job.json
│   ├── runner-template.sh
│   └── tester.sh
└── src
    └── hello.sh
```

At the top level, you will find a `Dockerfile` and `build.sh` script. These are
necessary for building the container reproducibly, and having them will facilitate
future app updates. The `deploy.sh` script is the final script of the app building
process which helps the user add their app to the Agave SD2E tenant.

The major subdirectory is named `hello-container-0.1.0/` - a concatenation of the
name of the app and the version of the executable. This directory contains both
`runner-template.sh`, which is a script directing how the app should be run upon
invocation, and `tester.sh`, which is a clone of `runner-template.sh` for testing
locally. Also included are template files `app.json` and `job.json` which contai
Agave-based descriptions of the app itself, and how the app should be run on an
Agave system.

Finally, the other subdirectory is a `src/` directory. It contains the source
code and runtime assets (reference files, libraries, etc.) required for your app.
In this example app, the only source file is the simple `hello.sh` shell script.


<br>
#### Set up to create your own app

Here, we will create an app for fastq quality control using the publicly available
[FastQC tool](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/).
Copy the `hello-container` template app and change the name to the app you would
like to develop:
```
% cp -r hello-container/ fastqc/
% cd fastqc/
% mv hello-container-0.1.0 fastqc-0.11.5/
```

The contents of the `fastqc/` app bundle should now appear as:
```
fastqc/
├── Dockerfile
├── build.sh
├── deploy.sh
├── fastqc-0.11.5
│   ├── _util
│   │   └── container_exec.sh
│   ├── app.json
│   ├── app.yml
│   ├── job.json
│   ├── runner-template.sh
│   └── tester.sh
└── src
    └── hello.sh
```

From this point forward, we will refer to this location on our local machine
as `~/fastqc/`. Next, we will edit the files necessary to containerize the FastQC
executable.
